# ClanGen CatMaker - Genemod edition

### By: Chinchbug, Original by KeyRaven 

Current version: 1.0

ClanGen Catmaker allows you to create cats using [ClanGen's](https://sablesteel.itch.io/clan-gen-fan-edit) and the [Genetic mod's](https://github.com/Chinch-Bug/clangen-genemod) art assets!

Future Plans:
- Currently none

This modded version takes [KeyRaven](https://github.com/keyraven)'s CatMaker codes and alters it to fit with how phenotypes are created and visualised by my Clangen mod

Please don't sell any images created, and provide proper attribution.
